## Test-taking strategies

- Really about time management

- Goal is to maximize points per unit time

- Remember:
    - Some questions are easier than others
    - Some questions are worth more points than others
    - Some questions give partial credit for writing formulae

- Manage your Yerkes-Dodson curve

## Two-way ANOVAs

Speaking of Yerkes-Dodson...

|               | Low anxiety   | High anxiety  |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Chopin        | 0,0,2,2       | 7,7,11,11     |
| SOAD          | 8,9,9,10      | 1,1,0,2       |

## Main effects

|               | Low anxiety   | High anxiety  |             |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Chopin        | 1             | 9             |  5          |
| SOAD          | 9             | 1             |  5          |
|               | 5             | 5             |             |

## Interactions

Since the actual math is a bit complicated, we'll use this trick:

`SS-interaction = SS-total - SS-rows - SS-columns - SS-within`
