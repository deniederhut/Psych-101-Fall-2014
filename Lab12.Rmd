## Linear regression

`outcome = constant + predictor + error`

`numeric score = mean of group 1 + difference between means (+ error)`

`binary outcome = baseline odds + treatment effect`

## You don't have to take my word for it

An independent samples t-test, looking at how much of a morning person you are based on gender

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
load("survey_data_cleaned.Rda")
t.test(Q17_morningperson ~ Q18_gender, data = data)
```

## You don't have to take my word for it

The same question, but run as a regression

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
summary(lm(Q17_morningperson ~ Q18_gender, data = data))
```

## Practice

1. Find correlation coefficient
2. Significance test for correlation coefficient
3. Find regression equation
4. Significance test for regression
5. Predict some values

## Time to bust out the calculators

|          | # of lectures | Exam grade  |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Alice    | 0             | 40          |
| Bob      | 8             | 70          |
| Chuck    | 6             | 75          |
| Eve      | 10            | 85          |

## It's easy to check your work in R

```{r}
x = c(0,8,6,10)
y = c(40,70,75,85)
cor.test(x = x, y = y)
```

## It's easy to check your work in R

```{r}
summary(lm(y ~ x))
```

## Lab Time!
