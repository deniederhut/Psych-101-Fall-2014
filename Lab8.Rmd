## The Independent t-test

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
library(ggplot2)
data <- data.frame(sample.1 = rnorm(n = 40, mean = 0), sample.2 = rnorm(n = 40, mean = 1))
ggplot(data = data) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = sample.1), fill = 'blue', alpha = 0.8, binwidth = 0.25) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = sample.2), fill = 'red', alpha = 0.8, binwidth = 0.25) + 
  ggtitle("Two samples drawn from unknown populations") + 
  xlab("") + ylab("Count")
```

## The Linear Model

General formulation:

`variable = constant + variables + random error`

Example:

`height = c + x1(sex) + x2(ethnicity) + x3(nutrition) + x4(age) + x5(hour) + e`

## Sources of error in t-tests

Dependent t-test:

`height = c{sex, ethnicity, nutrition} + x4(age) + e{hour, random error}`

Independent t-tests:

`height = c{} + x4(age) + e{sex, ethnicity, nutrition, hour, random error}`
