## The Math of Hypothesis Testing

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
library(ggplot2)
pop <- data.frame(pop1 = rnorm(n = 100000, mean = 0))
sam <- data.frame(pop2 = rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 1))
ggplot() + geom_histogram(data = pop, aes(x = pop1), binwidth = 0.25) + 
  geom_histogram(data = sam, aes(x = pop2, colour = 'red'), binwidth = 0.25) + 
  ggtitle("Sample with m = 1 compared to population of u = 0")
```
