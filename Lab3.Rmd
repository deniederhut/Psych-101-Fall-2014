## Z scores

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
load('/Users/dillonniederhut/Dropbox/Psych101/survey_data_cleaned.Rda')
library(ggplot2)
options(warn = -1)
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Q19_age)) + geom_dotplot() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(data$Q19_age, na.rm = TRUE), colour = 'red') + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = (mean(data$Q19_age, na.rm = TRUE) + sd(data$Q19_age, na.rm = TRUE))) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = (mean(data$Q19_age, na.rm = TRUE) - sd(data$Q19_age, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

## The distribution of sample means

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
dist <- rnorm(n = 1000)
for (n in c(1,4,16,25,49,100)){
  assign(paste0('sample',n), replicate(1000, mean(sample(dist,size = n,replace = TRUE))))
}
dosm <- data.frame(sample1,sample4,sample16,sample49,sample100)
ggplot(data = dosm) + geom_density(aes(x=sample1), colour = 'purple') + 
  geom_density(aes(x=sample4), colour = 'blue') +
  geom_density(aes(x=sample16), colour = 'green') +
  geom_density(aes(x=sample25), colour = 'yellow') +
  geom_density(aes(x=sample49), colour = 'orange') +
  geom_density(aes(x=sample100), colour = 'red') + 
  ggtitle('The distribution of sample means as a function of sample size from a normal population')
```

## The distribution of sample sd

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
popsd <- function(x){
  bar <- mean(x)
  N <- length(x)
  var <- sum((x - bar)**2)/N
  return(sqrt(var))
}
for (n in c(2,4,16,25)){
  assign(paste0('sample',n), replicate(1000, popsd(sample(dist,size = n,replace = TRUE))))
}
for (n in c(2,4,16,25)){
  assign(paste0('ssample',n), replicate(1000, sd(sample(dist,size = n,replace = TRUE))))
}
dosm <- data.frame(sample2,sample4,sample16,sample25,
                   ssample2,ssample4,ssample16,ssample25)
ggplot(data = dosm) + geom_density(aes(x=sample2), colour = 'purple') + 
  geom_density(aes(x=sample4), colour = 'blue') +
  geom_density(aes(x=sample16), colour = 'green') +
  geom_density(aes(x=sample25), colour = 'yellow') +
  geom_density(aes(x=ssample2), colour = 'purple', linetype = 'dashed') + 
  geom_density(aes(x=ssample4), colour = 'blue', linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_density(aes(x=ssample16), colour = 'green', linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_density(aes(x=ssample25), colour = 'yellow', linetype = 'dashed') +
  ggtitle('Biased and unbiased SD as a function of sample size from a normal population')
```

## Getting set up

- Login to your computers with:

- ID: !tmfpsych101

- Password: c@1thinking

- Start Rcommander with ```library(Rcmdr)```

- Class survey data is already downloaded for you - check the Class Folder

- You can ignore anything called `NA` - this is how R designates missing things

## Final paper

A research project conducted by you and 2-4 of your closest friends

You must have your group and **three** ideas for a research project by the 18th or 25th

The approved list of ideas is due **IN LECTURE** 30 Sept

For inspiration, try:

- annualreviews.org/journal/psych

- pss.sagepub.com/content/current

- reddit.com/r/psychology

- npr.org/sections/science

## Review time

- 40ish multiple choice questions, 10ish short answer

- Bring a **green** scantron sheet

- Focus on concepts and simple calculations

- Try the practice problems in the text book!

## Things you should know

- What is a variable? What kinds of variables can you have? What is a level?

- What is reliability? What is validity? Can a measure be reliable but not valid?

- What is a population? What is a sample? What is a score?

- What is central tendency? How do we measure it? Which way is best?

- What is variability? How do we measure it? Which way is best?
